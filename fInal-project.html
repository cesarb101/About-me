<h2>More About Me</h2>
<details>
<summary>My childhood</summary>
<p>I have always been a lover of the fall season, and the familiar welcoming cool air with some golden-leaves in the sunshine. Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by the french people and language.Compared to all the other kids, I was definitely more studious. You could have surely found me reading and doing homework pretending I had an important office job. I loved acting proffessional and always spoke with proper English and great vocabulary. If you could time travel, you would have thought I carried myself much older than my chronological age. I was also charmed by the economic success of highrises and the late night twinkle of cities. My favorite childhood memory would have to be when I visited Atlanta and saw a never-ending limousine coming our way. </p>
